# AR Campus Navigation App (Unity) for DiamondHacks

Welcome to our AR Campus Navigation App project developed for DiamondHacks, the hackathon organized by ACM UCSD. This Unity-based Android application aims to enhance campus navigation at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) using augmented reality (AR) technology.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to create an innovative AR app that assists users in navigating through the UCSD campus with real-time AR directional indicators and interactive campus mapping features. By leveraging Unity's AR Foundation, we aim to provide an immersive and intuitive navigation experience tailored specifically for the UCSD community.

## Key Features

- **AR Navigation Interface:** Real-time AR directional cues overlaid onto the physical environment for intuitive navigation.
  
- **Interactive Campus Mapping:** Integration of UCSD's campus data to accurately represent buildings, pathways, and points of interest in AR.
  
- **Personalized Navigation:** Customizable settings for walking speed, preferred routes, and accessibility options.
  
- **Points of Interest:** Highlighting campus landmarks and providing contextual information through interactive AR elements.
  
- **Offline Capability:** Support for offline mode with cached map data for areas with limited connectivity.
  
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Gesture-based controls and clear visual cues for a user-friendly navigation experience.

## Target Audience

- **UCSD Community:** Students, faculty, and visitors looking for a modern and interactive way to navigate the UCSD campus.
  
- **Prospective Students:** Individuals attending campus tours or events who want to explore UCSD efficiently.
  
- **Hackathon Participants:** Engaging with fellow participants and mentors at DiamondHacks to showcase our innovative AR application.

## Technology Stack

- **Unity 3D with AR Foundation:** Development platform for creating the AR navigation interface.
  
- **Mapping and Navigation Integration:** Utilizing UCSD's campus mapping data for accurate wayfinding.
  
- **Backend and Cloud Services:** Integration of cloud services for dynamic data updates and offline functionality.
